                <h3><strong> About </strong></h3><hr>
                <p>
                Welcome to my web resume! I'm a 3rd year Engineering Science (Aerospace) student at UofT with a particular passion for the intersection of robotics and 
                aerospace. I enjoy learning new things, am very adaptable, and have past work experience in formal lab settings. 
                I've worked on numerous deadline-driven design teams in the past, so I've developed the valuable skill of working with others toward a common goal under 
                time pressure. These environments have also led me to develop solid communication and time management skills. 
                Robotics and aerospace have been long-term passions of mine, stemming from a childhood love of space exploration, and I'd love to continue getting experience 
                working in those domains. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together, or if you'd just like to chat! <br><br>
                
                This site is intended to serve as a supplement to my resume. It contains information that I simply didn't have enough space to fit in my resume, but that 
                I still feel is important enough to talk about somwehere. Be sure to add me on LinkedIn, and take a look at my GitHub for examples of the (public) code 
                I've written!

            <strong>What is my degree?</strong><br>
            EngSci is probably not as ubiquitously known as other engineering disciplines. It is somewhat unique in that it contains a greater emphasis on 
            scientific theory than traditional engineering courses. At UofT, the program is very interdisciplinary, at the tradeoff of additional academic challenge 
            (more info can be found on the <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/">program website</a>). The first two years of EngSci are 
            general and cover a variety of topics from various engineering disciplines - including civil, mechanical, ECE, materials, and biomed. The next two years involve 
            specialization in a specific field of engineering (such as aerospace, robotics, biomed, etc.) I personally believe that the generality of the first two years 
            is extremely useful, because no field stands alone, and I have learned about so many connections between seemingly different fields of study over 
            the years. Additionally, gaining some knowledge about other fields is beneficial when working on interdisciplinary teams. Finally, this sort of general learning
            resonates personally with me, as I have always found it rewarding to learn new things just for the sake of it, even if they don't seem directly relevant 
            to me or my work. More often than not some of this knowledge ends up being unexpectedly useful. My specialization is in aerospace, 
            and out of interest I am also taking the required courses to obtain a minor in robotics, as well as a certificate in artificial intelligence. All of these 
            fields are passions of mine, and I had a hard time choosing to specialize between them - taking these extra courses has allowed me to get a taste of everything!
